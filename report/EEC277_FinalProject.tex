\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we implemented the beginnings of the Viola-Jones object detection method as it applies to faces. We also added a single feature classifier to detect the presence of glasses. To implement this on the GPU, we first find the integral image which is done serially because it is faster. Then, we cascade our identifiers and apply them using the integral image to minimize memory accesses. Finally, we present the list of our hypotheses for the location of the face back to the CPU. INSERT SOME JUNK ABOUT RESULTS HERE - NEED TO REDO THIS WITH MORE DETAILS - make it technical

\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we will address the application of face detection on the GPU. We used the Viola-Jones Object Detection algorithm to detect faces. We also added a glasses identifier to make an attempt at detecting whether the faces detected had glasses or not. We tested our algorithm on a subset of the Caltech Web Faces database and a subset of the Caltech 101 image database to analyze how accurate our implementation was. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of the implementation as well as some notable aspects of our specific implementation.

\section{Viola-Jones Object Detection}
Viola-Jones object detection focuses on using simple identifiers to determine whether the object exists in the image or not. The algorithm also performs object localization if sufficiently many identifiers are used. We used this algorithm to determine the presence (or lack thereof) of a face in an input image. The algorithm splits the image into numerous \emph{sub-windows} or small regions of the image upon which detection is applied.

\subsection{Integral Image}
To speed up computation of the identifiers, the Viola-Jones algorithm pre-computes the integral image. The integral image defines each pixel as the sum of all pixels that are both above and to the left of it. We explored both the standard serial implementation of computing the integral image from OpenCV as well as a parallel implementation.

The parallel implementation first performs a scan operation on the columns to create a sum for each pixel location of all the pixels above it. Then, the algorithm does a scan operation on the rows to add up all of the column sums for each pixel to the left of it. This calculates the sum of all of the pixels above and to the left of the current pixel.


\subsection{Cascade of Classifiers}
The classifiers are simple rectangular identifiers to determine different features of the face. To compute whether the classifier accepts that the given sub-window has a face, the algorithm subtracts the "black" area from the "white" area of the classifier. Figure 1 shows the classifiers we used for face detection. In the Viola-Jones paper, they use two hundred of these kinds of classifiers but we use a small subset of four classifiers because we are interested in how this algorithm applies to the GPU instead of the actual results. Four was sufficient to see the difficulties with implementing this algorithm on the GPU.

The other portion of Viola-Jones face detection was the use of a classifier \emph{cascade}. This means that the output of one classifier (which contains the list of sub-windows that may have a face) is the input for the next classifier. So if any classifier rejects a sub-window, the algorithm rejects the sub-window. If all of the classifiers accept a sub-window, then the algorithm says that there is a face at that subwindow. The alternative to the cascade approach is to apply all of the classifiers to every sub-window and define some number of acceptances that each sub-window needs to determine that there is a face there. We implemented both of these approaches to analyze which would be more efficient on the GPU.

\subsection{Glasses Classifier}
To extend the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm, we added a glasses classifier at the end of the classifier cascade to detect whether the face had glasses or not. Figure 2 shows the glasses classifier that we designed. The idea behind this classifier is that it will pick up on the portions of the frame that are on top of skin. Thus, the darker frame will be subtracted from the lighter skin areas on both the bridge of the glasses and the portion that goes, from the front, back to the ears.

\section{Results}
We ran the cascaded algorithm with three different datasets: faces, non-faces, and faces with glasses. The cascaded algorithm running on the faces dataset with 50 pictures produced a result of 49 faces detected and zero glasses detected. The same algorithm running with the non-face dataset with 50 pictures resulted in 38 faces detected and 8 glasses detected. The face detector ran on the glasses dataset with 25 pictures and found 24 face, 20 of which had glasses. Overall, the face detector has weak results with an accuracy of 92% but a false positive rate of 76%. The glasses classifier did well with an accuracy of 83.3% and a false positive rate of 21.1%. The entire cascaded face detection algorithm ran in 0.020334 seconds. The non-cascaded algorithm ran 65% slower at 0.033715 seconds. The glasses classifier ran in 0.004104 seconds. These timings are not absolute because it depends on the image and how the cascade can eliminate sub-windows early (reducing work for later stages).

\section{Discussion}
64 Threads per block, 3 kernel calls

Max occupancy is at 128 threads per block

Discuss how our results will scale with 200 classifiers instead of just 4 (really 3)

Talk about how one classifier didn't get positive values

Mention putting integral in shared memory as something we should have done but didn't

\section{Conclusion}
Conclusion goes here
